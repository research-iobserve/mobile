# iObserve General Architecture

The iObserve architecture comprises of four core services supplemented
by model storage, visualizations, and editors. The four services are:
- Analysis
- Prediction
- Planning
- Execution

They are loosely coupled via TCP/HTTP connects which allow to trigger
the "next" service if necessary.

## Analysis

Performs all the analysis and updates the PCM Runtime Model accordingly.
It also informs the visualization and the prediction service about
changes it has made on the PCM Runtime Model.

## Prediction

Performs predictions based on the PCM Runtime Model. It is triggered by
the analysis. Not shown in the figure, prediction can also be used on
model produced by the planning.

The prediction triggers planning, in case the prediction detects any
issues based on the current model.

Note: It is unclear of components of the prediction service are also
used in planning or the whole prediction service is reused, just with
different configurations.

## Planning

The planning gets a complete report on all immanent and predicted
issues. Based on that assessment, it computes pareto optimal future
deployments based on the model variation points.

These plans are stored in a planning repository. They can then be used
by the execution service and edited in the edit service.

The planning may automatically trigger the execution with a plan handle
in case operator intervention is not required.

## Execution

Based on operator intervention or triggered by the planning service,
the execution computes based on the present runtime model and either
a planned model or an operator model or a mixture thereof, an execution
plan. As the final execution plan relates to the actual system, it may
require access to the RAC as a general model-implementation mapping
model.

## Interfaces

### TCP Kieker

Continuous stream of Kieker events from multiple nodes.

### Update Visualization

The Update Visualization interface is triggered by the analysis service
and used to push visualization model changes to the Visualization
service. This allows the Analysis and the Prediction to enrich the
visualization with additional information.

### RAC Access

Provides read access to the RAC.

### PCM Access

Provides read and write access to one PCM model.

### PCM Select & Access

Provides read and write access to multiple PCM models combined with
a model selector.

### Model Select & Access

Allows to access different models in a model repository. For operator
models this includes, PCM models and fragments prepared by the operator,
edited PCM models and execution plans.

### Prediction Trigger

The Prediction Trigger informs the prediction service that the analysis
has updated the model and a prediction is required.

### Planning Trigger

In case issues were detected, the planning is triggered based on an
issue report.

### Planning Control

Separate from automatic triggered planning, an operator can trigger
planning through the Edit service.

### Auto Execution Trigger

In case immediate action is necessary, the planning can hand the
Execution a prescriptive model reference via this interface.
Based on that handle the Execution generates an adaptation plan and
executes it.

### Control Execution

The execution of a plan can also be issued by the operator via the
Control Execution interface.

Technically, this interface hands over an execution plan.
